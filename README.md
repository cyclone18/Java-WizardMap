# WizardMap
A Java project that simulates a grid navigation system, where tasks are completed by navigating through nodes, avoiding obstacles, and using custom wizard options. The project utilizes handcrafted data structures to handle grid representation, pathfinding, and mission objectives. Features Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for efficient route calculation.


The project can be run by typing "Java main input_file0 input_file1 input_file2 output_file" in the code terminal.
